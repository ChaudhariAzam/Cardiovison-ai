# Cardio Vision  AI
Project Description

CardioVision AI is an AI-powered Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis system designed to intelligently read, process, and interpret cardiac signals in real time. The project combines biomedical signal processing with machine learning techniques to detect heart rate, analyze waveform patterns, and identify potential cardiac abnormalities.

The system processes ECG data from sensors or datasets, applies noise filtering and signal enhancement, detects key waveform components (P-wave, QRS complex, T-wave), and computes important cardiac metrics such as BPM and RR intervals.

CardioVision AI is built to serve as a foundation for:
